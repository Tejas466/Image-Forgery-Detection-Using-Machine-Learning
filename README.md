# Image-Forgery-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
## Description:

In this project, we present a cutting-edge method for **Image Forgery Detection** using a novel combination of Error Level Analysis (ELA) and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. Our approach stands out for its robustness and high accuracy.

### Key Highlights:

- **Novel Approach:** Learn how we combine ELA with CNNs, where the output of ELA is used as input for the CNN, enhancing the detection of image forgeries.
  
- **Innovation and Results:** Discover the innovative aspects of our method and see how it achieved an impressive accuracy of **90.3%** in detecting various types of image forgeries. This accuracy can be fine-tuned to produce even better results.
  
- **Dataset Used:** We used the **CASIA 2.0** dataset available on Kaggle because of its reliability, robustness, and versatility in terms of the types of image forgeries present. This is a well-balanced dataset containing over **12,000+** images.
